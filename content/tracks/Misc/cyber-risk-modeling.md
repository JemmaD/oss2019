## Why

## What

Current Security Risk Management is Broken

There is a lot of complexity and uncertainty in cyber risk.
Current practice tends to hide uncertainty and present certainty.

We use Ordinal Scales (Red, Amber, Green / High, Medium, Low / 1,2,3,4,5 etc) rather than Cardinal measures (£ or %).
Is a red x red risk a really red risk? Twice as bad? Three times as bad?
We then assign numerical values to support ‘risk arithmetic’ (5 x 5 = 25 /2.5 = risk score)
OWASP Risk Rating Methodology (Risk Factors / Ordinal Scales)

We then use risk matrices that arbitrarily identify an ordinal boundary as the ‘risk appetite’. (Amber =Good, red = Bad).

By assigning a single value to probability and impact we are communicating a level of certainty about the outcome we don’t really have.

People are individually poor at prediction
Hedgehogs / Foxes / Superpredictors

We are awash with data about cyber events but few documented robust statistical methods deployed. 

The solutions are well known by other risk professions

Quantitative Risk Approaches

Probability of event
Range of outcomes (lognormal distribution)
Monte Carlo Simulation
Loss Exceedance Curves <- Business understands these
FAIR / OpenFAIR

Prediction Approaches
Risk Panels
Averaged predictions
Feedback !!!!!!!!!
Brier Scores 
Base Rate Data
Calibration
