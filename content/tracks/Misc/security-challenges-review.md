The "underlying assumptions" idea wasn't put forward on Tuesday, and is still half-formed; and I under-estimated how many people would be here for the entire week. Also my idea wasn't relevant to the participants of the Summit, as almost everyone is here for the entire week.

Also I think everyone interested in the higher strategic issues we face should attend the available Wardley Mapping sessions.

I'm available to discuss this at any point during the day during the breaks.
