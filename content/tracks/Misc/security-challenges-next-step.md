This is the latest version of this idea, partly inspired by a quick conversation with Dinis on Thursday evening.

## Outcomes

Answers to the following questions, raised during the week:

* Is the approach of finding similar industries or situations valid?
* Does Dave Snowden's experience support following or abandoning this methodology?
* If it's not valid, what methodologies should be used to create or find, and test, the correct strategies?
* Can we learn from other practitioners in related areas as a useable "hack" to choose effective new strategies rapidly?

* What are the underlying assumptions of the current strategies? Are those underlying assumptions valid?

* Is this area of study financially or practically viable?
