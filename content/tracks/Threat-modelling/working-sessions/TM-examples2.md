## WHY
This working session will collect threat models to add to our project.

## What
We will look at existing examples and jam some threat models on the spot!

Details about content formats and some examples are already available on https://linktr.ee/threatmodel.


## Outcomes

Have some threat models to add to the repository.

The official repository is not ready yet, but work will be on https://github.com/jmarcil/threat-model-cookbook at some point this week.
