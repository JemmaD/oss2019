This session will be referencing the work done by Tin Zaw as part of the Automated Threat Hunting OWASP project. Info: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications

##notes
Tin gives an overview on the project. The project has been running for 5 years now.

##outcomes
- close collaboration between the projects, any change on either end will be triggered (automated) so the other party is notified
- keep track of the data origin to notify the party of changes


##future
- communicate the data schema to the other parties where we retrieve data from
- figure out a way to have some kind of integration with other projects
