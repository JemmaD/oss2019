## Outcomes/Deliverables (recommend)

The outcome was a list of characteristics that could be used to describe the cyber security industry and the problems within it. This was sourced from everyone in attendance.

## Synopsis and Takeaways (recommend)

The list of characteristics is below:

* Adversarial
* Arrogant - Security knows best
* Asymmetric between us and adversary
* Auditors as adversaries
* Auto-didacts - self-taught
* Blame culture 
* Breach fatigue
* Built in feature
* Career paths undefined
* Constant Evolution (speed)
* Direct opponent to progress of other business areas
* Eternal, the game doesn't end
* Expert driven, technical experts
* Failure seen as normal
* Fear motivated
* Fragmented ( many different types of role? )
* Hoodie, public perception is incorrect
* Idiolect - it's own language and jargon
* Idiots – Ignorance, unreceptive
* Imposter syndrome
* Inter-dependency
* Lack of comparative data to judge who is winning or losing
* Lack of diversity in participants
* Lack of immediate reward / results for effort
* Lack of knowledge
* Media presence, in the public eye
* Mystical (it’s not when learnt or explained)
* No initiates or apprentices
* Optimisation Game
* Political
* Poor P.R. 
* Reactive - response to attacks
* Secret club, barriers to entry
* Transparent Success, no obvious indicators
* Ubiquitous - affects all 
* Untouchable adversaries aka “APT bullshit”


## Identified Questions

* What do we do with this list?
* How can we make this list useful?

## Important Conclusions

* There are many characteristics to the industry, especially when it is vaguely defined with the aim of encouraging brainstorming.
* There is a much greater interest in this analogical approach than the organiser originally expected.
* Expecting to define characteristics in a single word or phrase was overly optimistic. I suggest we work with what we have for now, but this approach should be modified in future.
