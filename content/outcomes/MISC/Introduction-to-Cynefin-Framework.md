## What is the Cynefin Framework? (after WIkipedia)

 - The Cynefin framework is a conceptual framework used to aid decision-making.
 - Created in 1999 by Dave Snowden when he worked for IBM Global Services, it has been described as a "sense-making device".] 
 - *Cynefin* is a Welsh word for habitat.[5]
 - Cynefin offers five decision-making contexts or "domains"
1.  Obvious (known until 2014 as simple)
2.  Complicated
3.  Complex
4.  Chaotic, and 
5.  Disorder

### Obvious 

 - Sense - Categorise - Respond
 - Rigid constraints
 - High risk of catastrophic failure (?)
 - Only effective where high degree of success all the time
 - If so over rigid people cannot do job, they will find workarounds
 - Workarounds teach people to ignore rules

### Complicated 

 - Sense - Analyse - Respond
 - Experts may know the correct response
 - See - Attend - Act
  - Seeing the data may not lead to action
 - Good practice not best practice as variation is allowed
 - Discretion to change response, where experience assured

### Complex

 - Exaptive* practise
 - Scale complex system by decomposition and recombination
 - Rapidly repurpose things you are good at to solve problems
 - Build capability to adapt to unknown situations that may occur in the future
 - Test for coherence - what might be causing it?
 - Probe in parallel
 - Create safe to fail experiments that look at 2 competing hypotheses
 - Short experiments - 2-3 months
 - Success
 - Application of constraints produces repeatable results
  - Move to “good practice”
 - Test frequently to ensure still successful, if not move back
 - If successful for long periods, move to “best practice”
 - Complexity is about understanding disposition states. Disposition changes can cause massive changes in the system.

 - **Exaptive** - *a process in which a feature acquires a function that was not acquired through natural selection*

 - These help managers identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people's behaviour.
 - The framework draws on research into systems theory, complexity theory, network theory and learning theories.

### Chaos was not addressed in this session

### Other

- Complexity is about understanding disposition states. Disposition changes can cause massive changes in the system.
 - Observer - Orientate - Decide - Act
 - If you can move through the cycle quicker than an opponent you will win - e.g., London Taxi vs. Uber
  - Taxi will always beat the Uber, but it takes a number of years to get the experience rather than learning to read a map
- Types of reasoning
  - Deductive - A then B
  - Inductive - All cases of A have B
  - Abductive - “logic of hunches”
