## Lessons learned

- Training sessions / user sessions / working sessions / panel session (conversation / AMA)
- Letâ€™s not wait another year, do more sessions using remote participation
- We split the content into smaller chunks; each can be a project and people have started two already
    - Call to action to be done on the OWASP TM slack channel
- Collaboration with DevSecOps project
    - Glossary
    - Content creation for both projects
- Hands-on training needed
- Action point for Steven W.:
    - Send a description of all decisions and important info on the slack channel
- Start with an example or important info so newer TMers can also contribute
- Schedule smarter, communicate better (especially on the expected knowledge level, tag + explanation), clarify that this is not a conference, it is about creating content
- Move away from GitHub for participants, sessions etc., keep it as user-friendly/frictionless as possible
- Ensure sessions can be viewed in different time zones instead of PM-1 etc. (Google calendar)
