## Description of session

The session objective was to discuss and answer the questions below.



| Question  | Parameters |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **1. How do we measure the maturity of a threat model?** | Data is stored & linkable (higher maturity) <br /> Formalisation (higher maturity) <br /> Process integration <br /> How is the model created? different levels of maturity <br /> Repeatability of the process <br /> Level of TM depth + classification of systems <br /> Re-usable components <br /> Maturity / knowledge / experience of the threat modeler + audience <br /> How much does the TM relate to the actual application (quality degradation over time) / synced versioning <br />  Relation / causation between requirements and the resulting TM |
| **2. How do we measure the maturity of the threat model process?** | Level 0: ad hoc threat model(s), free form <br />  Level 1: implement a threat model methodology and <br />   - Classification of systems and levels of TM depth <br />   - Accurate documentation that reflects reality <br /> - Ownership is within the security/architecture team? <br /> Level 2: threat model process is integrated in the SDLC / repeatability / formalisation / digitasation + linkability / libraries (e.g., attack) / feedback cycle on threat intel. (e.g., library vulns.) |
| **3. Can maturity frameworks be updated with our measurements?**| Yes: SAMM <br />   - Talk about the process not the maturity of the TM itself |
