## Description of session

This practical session on creating Wardley maps considered the following aspects of Wardley maps:

- Shared and reviewed Wardley maps
   - Non-security specific
   - Across a number of different industries
   - Use-cases as examples of good mapping

 - High-level review of related articles to
   - Lay out processes or approaches to develop Wardley maps
   - Resources [here](https://opensecsummit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/)
 
 - Analysed proposal for "map of security mapping"
   - Generated useful conversations
   - Sharing of insight in terms of 
      -  Positioning of elements on the map
      -  Consensus -approach was appropriate and the elements relevant
      - See [proposal](https://twitter.com/madplatt/status/1135850419538804736) 
     
 
 - Presented a set of proposals on using Wardley Maps to capture security scenarios based on Cyber Essentials compliance, which covers: 
   - Patch Management
   - User access control
   - Malware protection
   - Firewalls 
   - Hardening/Secure Configuration.


## Outcomes/Deliverables 

 - Review and feedback on map of security mapping
 - Agreement on usefulness of maps for assessing particular parts of a security landscape
 - Following feedback received, the map was updated as follows:

## Next steps

 - Update in the relevant section all the resources that were reviewed plus additional ones that were shared during the session
 - Add the security scenarios and use cases discussed in the meeting to an OSS template
