## Description of session

This practical session on creating Wardley maps considered the following aspects of Wardley maps:

 - Shared and reviewed Wardley maps
⋅⋅* Non-security specific
⋅⋅* Across a number of different industries
⋅⋅* Use-cases as examples of good mapping

 - High-level review of related articles to
 ⋅⋅* Lay out processes or approaches to develop Wardley maps
 ⋅⋅* Resources [here](https://opensecsummit.org/tracks/wardley-maps/)
 
  - Analysed proposal for "map of security mapping"
 ⋅⋅* Generated useful conversations
 ⋅⋅* Sharing of insight in terms of 
 ⋅⋅* Positioning of elements on the map

 ⋅⋅* See [proposal](https://twitter.com/madplatt/status/1135850419538804736) 
 
 - Presented a set of proposals on using Wardley Maps to capture security scenarios based on Cyber Essentials compliance, which covers 
⋅⋅* Patch Management
⋅⋅* User access control
⋅⋅* Malware protection
⋅⋅* Firewalls 
⋅⋅* Hardening/Secure Configuration.
