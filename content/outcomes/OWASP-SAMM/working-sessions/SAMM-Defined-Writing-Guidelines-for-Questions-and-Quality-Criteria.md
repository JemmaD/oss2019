* Vocabulary 
   * Be consistent throughout the model
   * Store your checklists in an accessible location 
   * Be specific
        * Instead of  having “fully documented processes”
        * Ensure you have enough information to recreate the build
 * Scope
   * If something applies to all questions, say so at the beginning,

   * Be specific in the question, use the same concepts and similar wording; have the reference in the text
   * Consider adding a section in the markdown for internal references
