## Description of session

- Discussed and assessed possible options of re-categorizing, replacing categories with tags, removing any of the ‚≠ê to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê difficulty levels. 
- Decided upon staying with the general setup but introducing some new more precise categories, make challenge descriptions clearer and more consistent etc.

## Outcomes

Please see https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/issues/1093

## Next steps

- Implement #1093 (but not for v8.7.0  üòÄ)
- Peer review the Hacking Instructor and its elegant new way of writing tutorial scripts in Typescript
- Merge the open GSoC PRs and continue with the delivery address feature
- Get rid of the last remaining "xit" (=disabled) tests
- Anything new and fancy that *you* come up with
